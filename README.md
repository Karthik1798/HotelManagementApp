Problem Definition:
Although the basic type of services offered by a hotel depends upon the customer requirements, services provided usually include:
1.	Booking the rooms based on the customer's choice.
2.	Providing the room services.
3.	Payment options.
4.	Admin functions to maintain the hotel records.
 
Motivation behind this project:
The current manual system uses paperwork and direct human language communication to manage the hotel. This delays information transmission in the hotel. The chance of human error like data losses are high in this conventional method. This can be avoided by digitalizing the system. This hotel management software overcomes all those issues.
